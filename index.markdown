I am an Assistant Professor in the [Institute of Service Science](https://www.iss.nthu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"} at the [College of Technology Management](http://www.ctm.nthu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"}, [National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"} where I teach courses related to business analytics and causal inference using experimental and observational studies.

Before joining NTHU, I was a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the [Center of Business Education and Research](https://cber.shanghai.nyu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [New York University (NYU) Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I was advised by [Prof. Yuxin Chen](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yuxin-chen){:target="_blank"}. I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Business and Technology Management](https://btm.kaist.ac.kr/en/){:target="_blank"}, [KAIST College of Business](https://www.business.kaist.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/){:target="_blank"}. My Ph.D. advisor was [Prof. Wonjoon Kim](https://wjkim.kaist.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests lie in the intersection of innovation, information systems, and marketing. I am particularly interested in answering _"what are the societal and economic impacts of emerging technologies and how do we understand the underlying mechanisms?"_ My methodological (research) interests are centered on the application of causal inference methods such as matching/weighting estimators, regression discontinuity designs, and synthetic difference in differences. I have also worked on designing and conducting large-scale randomized controlled trials by engaging in industry collaborations.
