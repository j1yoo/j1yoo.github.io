I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate studying quantitative marketing and innovation at [KAIST College of Business](http://www.business.kaist.edu/). I passed my qualification exam in Aug. 2014, and am A.B.D (all but dissertation) since 2015. I am interested in investigating the short-term and long-term impact of marketing on consumer decision-making.
