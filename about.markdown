I am a Ph.D. candidate studying quantitative marketing and innovation at [KAIST](http://www.business.kaist.edu/). I passed my qualification exam in Aug. 2014, and am A.B.D (all but dissertation) since 2015. I am interested in investigating the short-term and long-term impact of marketing on consumer decision-making in the era of digitalization. 

Specifically, one of the essays in my dissertation investigates the impact of digitization in the payment industry (i.e., third party mobile payments such as Google pay, WeChat pay, and Kakao pay) on consumption behavior (preparing for submission at the Marketing Science: Frontier). I use a mixture of quasi-experimental methods in conjunction with noble fine-grained customer purchase data and further dig into elucidating the treatment effects, heterogeneity, as well as the underlying mechanism by conducting a battery of identification tests and robustness checks.

I have also worked on a large scaled field experiment in collaboration with a book retailer where my coauthors and I have investigated how mobile content marketing can be used to resolve the two pertaining issues with mobile marketing (i.e., low engagement and low conversion; preparing for submission at the Journal of Marketing).
