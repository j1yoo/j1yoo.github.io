  <p class="intro">I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate studying quantitative marketing and innovation at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/index.html">KAIST</a>. I passed my qualification exam in Aug. 2014, and am A.B.D (all but dissertation) since 2015. I am interested in investigating the short-term and long-term impact of marketing on consumer decision-making.</p>
