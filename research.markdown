* "Mobile payments revolution: the impact of third party mobile payments on customer mobile purchase behavior" with Yuxin Chen, Minki Kim, and Wonjoon Kim. Preparing for submission to _Marketing Science_
  * __Abstract__  The advent of the digitized economy is changing the payment landscape as we know it. Incorporating new body-mapping technologies such as fingerprint scanning, third-party mobile payments, e.g., Google pay, WeChat pay, and Kakao pay, are gathering a strong customer base. These newly emerging mobile payment services, from the usersâ€™ standpoint, bring about a substantial shift in their transaction experience as they require fewer tasks to be completed in comparison to the incumbent payment options such as credit card. Drawing from the transaction cost theory and the literature on consumer psychology, this paper delineates and empirically analyzes the behavioral consequences of the third-party mobile payments under the setting where the customers purchase books in offline stores using their mobile phones. The results confirm that the adoption of a third-party mobile payment significantly increases consumer spending, consumption variety, and bestseller consumption, but decreases concentration on personal favorites. Also, supplementary analyses reveal that there is heterogeneity in the treatment effects and that these effects are not driven by the customers simply migrating from other channels. We discuss the implications for consumers and suppliers of the third-party mobile payments.

* "Overcoming the challenges of mobile marketing: mobile content marketing in a distracted world" with Seokjoon Yoon, Minki Kim, Wonjoon Kim, Minsok Lee. Submitted to _Management Science_
  * __Abstract__  Mobile marketing, despite its popularity among marketers, has yet to overcome the persistent challenges of consumer apathy and short attention span, thus resulting in low engagement and conversion. Although mobile content marketing (MCM) has emerged as an alternative solution to such challenges in practice, academic research on the effectiveness and strategies of MCM is still in its infancy. This study aims to investigate the causal impact of MCM on customer engagement and sales. To this end, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in close collaboration with both a book retailer and a large number of publishers. We empirically confirm the effectiveness of MCM by showing that it is capable of increasing both customer engagement (e.g., higher check-in rate) and sales revenue (e.g., higher click-through and sales conversion), but its success is largely determined by the quality of the content being used. Our findings confirm that MCM can backfire if not implemented properly. While informative and entertaining content is consumed more, entertaining content that better sustains readers' attention can be even more effective.
