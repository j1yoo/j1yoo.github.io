__Abstract__  The advent of the digitized economy has changed the payment landscape. Incorporating new biometric technologies such as face recognition or fingerprint scanning, third-party mobile payments (e.g., Google pay, WeChat pay, and Kakao pay) are gathering a strong customer base. These newly emerging mobile payment services, from the users' standpoint, bring about a substantial shift in their transaction experience as they require fewer tasks to be completed in comparison to the incumbent payment options such as credit card. Drawing from the transaction cost theory and the literature on consumer psychology, therefore, this paper delineates and empirically analyzes the behavioral consequences of the third-party mobile payments under the setting where the customers purchase books in offline stores using their mobile phones. The results confirm that the adoption of a third-party mobile payment significantly increases consumer spending and consumption variety, but decreases concentration on personal favorites. Interestingly, the adoption increases purchase frequency per trip and maximum price of the books purchased as well. Furthermore, supplementary analyses reveal that there exists heterogeneity in the treatment effects and that these effects are not driven by the customers simply migrating from other channels. Also, additional robustness checks are conducted to rule out alternative explanations and confirm the validity of the results. We discuss the implications for consumers and retailers utilizing mobile payment services.

__Abstract__  Mobile marketing, despite its popularity among marketers, has yet to overcome the persistent challenges of consumer’s short attention span and apathy towards digital ads, thus resulting in low engagement and conversion. Although mobile content marketing (MCM) has emerged as an alternative solution to such challenges in practice, academic research on the effectiveness and strategies of MCM is still in its infancy. This study aims to investigate the causal impact of MCM on customer engagement and sales. To this end, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in close collaboration with both a book retailer and a large number of publishers. We empirically confirm the effectiveness of MCM by showing that it is capable of increasing both customer engagement (e.g., higher check-in rate) and sales revenue (e.g., higher click-through and sales conversion), but its success is largely determined by the quality of the content being used. Our findings confirm that MCM can backfire if not implemented properly. While informative and entertaining content is consumed more, entertaining content that better sustains readers’ attention can be even more effective.
