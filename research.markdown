__Abstract__ The advent of the digitized economy has changed the payment landscape. Incorporating new biometric technologies such as face recognition, voice recognition, and fingerprint scanning, mobile payment services (e.g., Google Pay, WeChat Pay, Kakao Pay) are gathering a strong customer base. From a user's standpoint, these emerging mobile payment services represent a substantial shift in the transaction experience as they require fewer tasks to complete than incumbent payment options such as credit cards. Drawing from transaction cost theory and the consumer psychology literature, this paper delineates and empirically analyzes the behavioral consequences of mobile payments in a setting in which customers purchase books in offline stores using their mobile phones. The results confirm that adopting mobile payments significantly increases consumer spending and consumption variety but decreases concentration on personal favorites. Consumers also increase purchase frequency per trip and maximum price of books purchased. Supplementary analyses reveal that these effects are not driven by the long-term promotion effect, availability of mobile payment services, or customers simply migrating from other channels. Identification test results and robustness checks repeatedly confirm the validity of the theoretical foundation, mechanisms, and main results. The paper concludes with implications for consumers and retailers.

__Abstract__  Mobile marketing, despite its popularity among marketers, has yet to overcome the persistent challenges of consumer’s short attention span and apathy towards digital ads, thus resulting in low engagement and conversion. Although mobile content marketing (MCM) has emerged as an alternative solution to such challenges in practice, academic research on the effectiveness and strategies of MCM is still in its infancy. This study aims to investigate the causal impact of MCM on customer engagement and sales. To this end, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in close collaboration with both a book retailer and a large number of publishers. We empirically confirm the effectiveness of MCM by showing that it is capable of increasing both customer engagement (e.g., higher check-in rate) and sales revenue (e.g., higher click-through and sales conversion), but its success is largely determined by the quality of the content being used. Our findings confirm that MCM can backfire if not implemented properly. While informative and entertaining content is consumed more, entertaining content that better sustains readers’ attention can be even more effective.
