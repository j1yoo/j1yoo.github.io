   <summary><span style="color:gray">[Abstract]</span></summary>
   In today's dynamic retail environment, mobile Scan-and-Go services are providing a new way for consumers to shop in-store. To better understand this new retailing practice, we collaborated with a premier book retailer in Asia, which has a well-established mobile Scan-and-Go service. Our findings, based on detailed transactional data, reveal that these users tend to consume a more diverse range of products compared to non-users. More importantly, we show that mobile payment adoption within the context of Scan-and-Go further amplifies the consumption variety of those users. Utilizing a difference-in-differences approach coupled with propensity score matching, we find that mobile payment adoption \jaewonfive{leads to a significant reduction in the normalized Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) across multiple dimensions of consumption. This reduction in HHI indicates that users are diversifying their consumption by exploring a broader range of categories.} Additionally, we observe a positive impact on overall spending. Grounded in transaction cost theory, our research underscores that the reduction in transaction costs is a key mechanism driving these changes. Our study contributes to the understanding of payment methods and retail technologies, providing novel insights into the strategic use of technological advancements to enhance consumer behavior and bolster emerging sales channels. Our findings offer strategic implications for retailers aiming to leverage technology to thrive in a rapidly evolving market. <br/><br/> </details>


- "Overcoming the Challenges of Mobile Marketing: Mobile Content Marketing in a Distracted World" with Seokjoon Yoon, Minki Kim, Wonjoon Kim, Minsok Lee (resubmission requested at _Management Science_).

  <summary><span style="color:gray">[Abstract]</span></summary>
Mobile marketing, despite its popularity among marketers, has yet to overcome the persistent challenges of consumer apathy and short attention span, thus resulting in low engagement and conversion. Although mobile content marketing (MCM) has emerged as an alternative solution to such challenges in practice, academic research on the effectiveness and strategies of MCM is still in its infancy. This study aims to investigate the causal impact of MCM on customer engagement and sales. To this end, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in close collaboration with both a book retailer and a large number of publishers. We empirically confirm the effectiveness of MCM by showing that it is capable of increasing both customer engagement (e.g., higher check-in rate) and sales revenue (e.g., higher click-through and sales conversion), but its success is largely determined by the quality of the content being used. Our findings confirm that MCM can backfire if not implemented properly. While informative and entertaining content is consumed more, entertaining content that better sustains readers’ attention can be even more effective. <br/><br/> </details>


- "Helping Hands to Bear the Burden of Choice: Recommendations from Similar, but Not Close, Others Reduce Choice Difficulty" with Wonjoon Kim and Joshua Ackerman (resubmission requested at _Journal of Marketing_).
  <details>
  <summary><span style="color:gray">[Abstract]</span></summary>
The introduction of the Internet generated two significant developments for consumers—the emergence of social network services and relentlessly increasing product variety. However, recent research has highlighted the negative consequences of extensive choice variety and how it overloads cognition. Three experimental studies and a pilot study show that social recommendations appearing in the choice context mitigate assortment-driven choice difficulty, thereby eliminating choice overload effects. Interestingly, this effect is moderated by the similarity, but not by the felt social distance, between the recommendation provider and the chooser. In other words, consumers who are burdened by choice difficulty are more likely to choose the alternative recommended by similar others, which allows them to reduce the difficulty of evaluating other options available in the assortment – an activity that can produce dissatisfaction and choice deferral. <br/><br/> </details>


**Work-in-Progress**

- "From What Ifs to Insights: Counterfactuals in Causal Inference vs. Explainable AI" with G. Shmueli, D. Martens, and T. Greene
  <details>
  <summary><span style="color:gray">[Abstract]</span></summary>
Counterfactuals play a pivotal role in the two distinct data science fields of causal inference (CI) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While the core idea behind counterfactuals remains the same in both fields—the examination of what would have happened under different circumstances—there are key differences in how they are used and interpreted. We introduce a formal definition that encompasses the multi-faceted concept of the counterfactual in CI and XAI. We then discuss how counterfactuals are used, evaluated, generated, and operationalized in CI vs. XAI, highlighting conceptual and practical differences. By comparing and contrasting the two, we hope to identify opportunities for cross fertilization across CI and XAI.  <br/><br/> </details>

Incorporating a combination of emerging technologies such as global positioning system sensors, smart locks, mobile payments, and the dockless feature, last mile mobility services such as Lime, Mobike, and Kick-Going are gathering a strong customer base. As the name suggests, these newly emerging mobility services are effective means to solving the `last mile problem' by providing a convenient option to its users to move from (to) a transportation hub to (from) their final destination using a moble app. This means that the emergence of last mile mobility is likely to alleviate the inefficiency inherent in the public transit systems thereby allowing its users to save both money and time spent to travel. Despite the expected welfare gains, there is an increased concern regarding its potential effects to traffic accidents and the fatality associated with it. In this paper, we exploit a unique data, which puts together the FARS traffic accident recordings across different cities in the U.S. and Lime's individual ridership data such as the average miles traveled, using a standard generalized difference-in-differences approach at the neighborhood level. We expect that our findings will provide empirical evidence of the negative effect of last mile mobility services in terms of traffic fatality. This, in part, is likely driven by the lack of policies and regulations that are yet to follow up with the changing landscape within the mobility market due to the introduction of last mile mobility services. The relevant implications will also be discussed. <br/><br/> </details>
